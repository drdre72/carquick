# 🧪 CarQuick Test Page Guide

## 📍 Location
**File:** `src/pages/Bookings.taem4.js`  
**URL:** `/bookings` (or whatever URL the Bookings page is mapped to in Wix)

## 🎯 What This Test Does

This is a **comprehensive test page** that will help us debug why the JavaScript isn't working on the frontend:

### 🔍 Tests Performed:
1. **JavaScript Execution** - Confirms JS is running
2. **$w.onReady** - Tests Wix page initialization
3. **Element Access** - Tries to find and update text elements
4. **Console Logging** - Extensive debug output
5. **Element Enumeration** - Lists all available page elements
6. **Basic Wix Features** - Tests localStorage, timers, etc.

### 📱 How to Test:

1. **Open Wix Studio**
2. **Navigate to the Bookings page** (the one we converted to test page)
3. **Open Preview Mode**
4. **Open Browser Developer Tools** (F12)
5. **Go to Console tab**
6. **Look for test output**

### 🔍 Expected Console Output:
```

## 🔧 Debugging

### If You See Console Output:
- ✅ **JavaScript is working!**
- The issue might be with specific element IDs or template conflicts
- We can proceed to add actual UI elements

### If You DON'T See Console Output:
- ❌ **JavaScript execution is blocked**
- Check Wix Studio settings
- Verify the page is published/preview-enabled
- Check for any Wix platform restrictions

### If You See Errors:
- 📝 **Copy the exact error messages**
- Share them so we can debug specific issues
- The test will still run and show what's working vs broken

## 🎯 Next Steps Based on Results

### ✅ If Tests Pass:
We know JavaScript works and can:
1. Add real UI elements to blank pages
2. Create proper text elements and buttons
3. Build out the full CarQuick functionality

### ❌ If Tests Fail:
We need to:
1. Check Wix platform restrictions
2. Verify page publishing settings
3. Look for alternative approaches (like using Wix built-in apps)
